Update information to update to version >= 0.3.1
================================================================================
These update information only apply to users, who update from version 0.3 or 
earlier. Later versions will do all necessary updates on their own. 

You only have to do these steps, if you want to keep your current configuration.
If you don't care about your current configuration you may delete your current
installation and then start with the new one from scratch.

There are some steps to do before you run the new version:
1. Create a file vodcatcherhelper.properties in the main directory
2. Insert the following statement into vodcatcherhelper.properties
   db.version=0.1   , if you are updating from version 0.2 or below
   db.version=0.3   , if you are updating from version 0.3 or above
3. Start your _OLD_ version of Vodcatcher Helper
4. Vodcatcher Helper now inserts the new parameter db.version into the database.
   After Vodcatcher Helper started, you can stop it again.
5. Delete the vodcatcherhelper.properties again, if you want to.
6. Copy the new version of Vodcatcher Helper to the main directory.
7. Start the new version.
